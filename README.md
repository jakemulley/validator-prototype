# Very Basic Register Validator (Prototype)

This is a very basic Register validator for Brownfield Sites. It uses Brownfield Sites and the [Brownfield Sites Data Standard](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/653657/BrownfieldLandRegisters_-_DataStandard.pdf) as an example.
